## Problem Statement

As an administrator, I want to see how my website web pages are linked to my home page so that I can manually search for ways to improve my SEO rankings.

## Technical Design

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a PHP web crawler that systematically navigates a website, identifies internal links, and analyzes the link structure. This analysis will help the administrator make informed decisions to optimize SEO rankings.

### Technology Stack
- Language: PHP
- Libraries: guzzle/Http Client for HTTP requests
- Data Storage:  Database for storing crawled data

### Key Components

1. **Crawling Algorithm:**
   - Start from the home page.
   - Use guzzle to fetch the HTML content.
   - Parse HTML for anchor tags and extract URLs.


2. **Data Structure:**
   - Store crawled data using databases.
   - Record source and destination URLs.

3. **Recursion:**
   - Implement recursive navigation through linked pages.


5. **User Interface (Optional):**
   - Create a user interface for input and result visualization.

6. **Optimization for Performance:**
   - Implement performance optimizations, including request delays.

7. **Extensibility:**
    - Design for future improvements and features.

##  Technical Decisions
When designing a PHP web crawler to analyze a website's internal link structure for SEO improvement, several technical decisions are made to ensure the system's efficiency, accuracy, and ethical compliance. Here are the key technical decisions and the reasons behind each one:

1. **Choice of Programming Language (PHP):**
   - PHP is a server-side scripting language commonly used for web development.
   - **Reason**: PHP is well-suited for web crawling tasks as it allows for easy HTTP requests, HTML parsing, and database integration.

2. **Use of Guzzle client for HTTP Requests:**
   - Guzzle client is a library for transferring data with URLs.
   - **Reason**: Guzzle is a reliable and versatile tool for making HTTP requests. It allows handling redirects, cookies, and custom headers, which are essential for crawling websites.

3. **Database for Data Storage:**
   - A relational database or other data storage mechanism may be used to store crawled data.
   - **Reason**: Databases provide a structured way to store and query data, which is beneficial for large-scale crawling and analysis. It allows for efficient data retrieval and reporting.

4. **Recursive Crawling Algorithm:**
   - The crawler follows internal links, navigating through the website page by page.
   - **Reason**: A recursive approach ensures that all accessible pages are crawled, and their links are analyzed. It provides a systematic way to explore the website.

5. **URL Filtering and Exclusion:**
   - Implement filters to exclude URLs that are not relevant (e.g., external links, media files, or administrative pages).
   - **Reason**: Filtering reduces noise in the data and allows the crawler to focus on internal links, which are crucial for SEO analysis.

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Thoroughly test the crawler on various websites to ensure its accuracy, performance, and reliability.
   - **Reason**: Rigorous testing helps identify and fix issues, ensuring that the crawler operates as expected and delivers accurate results.

7. **Optimization for Performance:**
    - Implement techniques to optimize performance, such as adding delays between requests.
    - **Reason**: Optimization ensures that the crawler operates efficiently and doesn't put unnecessary strain on the website's server.

8. **Extensibility:**
    - Design the crawler with extensibility in mind, allowing for future improvements and additional features.
    - **Reason**: An extensible design makes it easier to adapt the crawler to changing requirements and accommodate new functionalities.

Each of these technical decisions is made to create a reliable and effective web crawler that can systematically analyze a website's internal link structure, aiding administrators in making informed decisions for SEO improvement while adhering to ethical and practical considerations.

## How the Solution Achieves the Desired Outcome

- The PHP web crawler systematically navigates the website, mapping internal links.
- Data is collected, and link relationships are recorded.
- Results can be visualized in user-friendly formats.
- The administrator can analyze the link structure for SEO optimization.
- Testing ensures accuracy and reliability.
- The extensible design allows for future enhancements.

This solution empowers the administrator to make informed decisions, enhancing SEO rankings by optimizing the website's internal link structure.


## How I approach a problem

The approach I described for problem-solving is a widely adopted and effective method that I use because it helps ensure a systematic, structured, and efficient way to tackle various types of problems. Here's why I chose this approach:

1. **Clarity and Understanding:** By first understanding the problem and defining its scope, I avoid jumping into a solution without a clear understanding of the problem's nuances and requirements. This helps prevent wasted effort and resources.

2. **Decomposition:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems or tasks makes the overall problem more manageable. It also allows me to focus on solving one part at a time, which can be less overwhelming.

3. **Planning:** Formulating a plan or strategy provides a roadmap for how to approach the problem. It helps me think through the steps and consider the best course of action before diving into implementation.

4. **Testing and Verification:** Rigorous testing is essential to ensure the solution works correctly. This step helps catch errors early and verify that the solution meets the requirements.

5. **Documentation:** Documenting the solution is crucial for future reference, code maintenance, and collaboration. It makes it easier for others to understand and work with the code.

6. **Optimization and Efficiency:** Considering optimization and improvement is a proactive approach to enhancing the quality and performance of the solution. It ensures that the solution not only works but works efficiently.

7. **Communication:** Clear communication of results is essential, especially when working as part of a team or when stakeholders are involved. It helps others understand the solution and its implications.

8. **Reflection and Learning:** Continuous learning and self-improvement are critical. Reflecting on the problem-solving process and learning from challenges and mistakes lead to growth and skill development.

This approach is also versatile and can be adapted to various domains and types of problems, whether they involve programming, decision-making, creative thinking, or project management. It provides a structured framework for problem-solving that increases the likelihood of finding effective and efficient solutions.

Additionally, this problem-solving approach is in line with best practices in software development and project management, which prioritize understanding the problem, planning, testing, and documentation to produce high-quality results.
